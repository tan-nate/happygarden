# happygarden

happygarden is a garden where you can grow plants and tend to them with others. To start the app, clone this repo. cd into the happygarden-backend directory and run "bundle install". Run "rake db:migrate", then "rails s". Open the index.html file in the latest version of Google Chrome (I can confirm it doesn't work in Safari probably due to something with the easeljs library). 

Any and all improvements and suggestions are greatly appreciated and welcome. Thank you to the easeljs library for the canvas functionality (https://www.createjs.com/easeljs).
